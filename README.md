# PYTHON SPAM BOT

This spam bot sends automated messages. It can be used for many things including sending reminders, adverstising, or just pissing off your friends. 

## Description

This program uses the pyautogui module to create a spam bot. It has built in input validation and is simple to use and make your own. To customize you can edit the 
time waited in between messages. You can customize the spam bot without editing the code as well with inputs that allow the user to tell the bot how many messages
they want sent out and what they want the message to contain. This bot is intended to be used on Instagram but it should work on any text field the same way. If you
decide to use the bot on instagram i'd recommend creating a new account or messaging from an account you dont acre about just in case ;)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

pyautogui is needed before running the program:

windows: [py -m pip install pyautogui]

macos and linux: [python3 -m pip install pyautogui] 

for more information: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html 


### Executing program

1. Download the project from the Spam_Bot.py file attached to this repository
2. Open the file in the IDE of your choice.
3. Make any customiztions that you want (increassing or decreasing wait time)
4. Have the text field you want to use ready (I started with a blank text editor to test)
5. Run your code and have fun!


## Help

If the program is running but isn't typing out the messages onto the text field make sure whatever IDE you are using has accessibility privaleges for your machine. 
It should inform you if there is an issue about accessibility.

If your bot is typing the text into one message instead of multiple make sure the messaging application you are using uses the enter key to send messages. If it doesn't 
then the messages will not send.
